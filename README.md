## Feedforward Modeling (Without Captions)

For starters, I tried to just fit a regular convolutional neural network. 
I believe in this particular problem, P(inner | outer, caption) is not very multimodal.
So, it should _technically_ be possible that a vanilla CNN gives good results.
However, this was not the case.

Samples forthcoming.
